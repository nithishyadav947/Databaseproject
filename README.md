# Databaseproject
This Python script helps normalize a database table to the specified normal form (1NF to 5NF). It reads a CSV dataset and uses user-defined dependencies (FDs, MVDs, and JDs) to break down the table as needed. The final result includes SQL CREATE TABLE statements and schema details saved to a text file.
